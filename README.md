# Squawk

## Description

A Twitter reader that searches your timeline for URLs that have been tweeted more than once.

## Background

If you only check your Twitter timeline once a day, you'll only see a few tweets from that day. Squawk takes the last ~2,000 tweets from your timeline and finds the links that have been mentioned more than once by people you follow. 

## Usage

Click the parrot, OAuth into Twitter, get your squawks.
