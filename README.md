## Description

A Twitter reader that searches your timeline for URLs that have been tweeted more than once.

If you only check your Twitter timeline once a day, you'll only see a few tweets from that day. Squawk takes the last ~1,000 tweets from your timeline and finds all the links that have been mentioned by 2 or more people who you follow. 

## Usage
